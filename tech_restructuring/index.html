        <h1>The Great Tech Reshuffling: AI's Impact on Jobs in 2025</h1>
        <div class="meta">A personal take on what's really happening in the industry</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Numbers Don't Lie</h2>
        <p>We're witnessing something unprecedented in the tech world. Major companies are cutting deep into their workforce, and it's not just about economic downturns anymore. Microsoft has eliminated around 9,000 roles, Intel is planning cuts of up to 24,000 positions (that's nearly 20% of their staff), and TCS has trimmed about 12,000 roles.</p>
        
        <div class="stats">
            <strong>The reality check:</strong> Global tech job cuts in 2025 have already surpassed 100,000 positions, and we're not even through the year yet.
        </div>
        
        <p>But here's what's different this time - these aren't just cost-cutting measures during tough economic times. Companies are fundamentally restructuring how they operate, and AI is at the center of it all.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why This Is Really Happening</h2>
        <p>The traditional explanation of "economic pressures" only tells part of the story. What we're seeing is a massive capital reallocation. Companies are pulling money from legacy roles and pouring it into AI infrastructure and automation. Microsoft alone is investing over $80 billion in AI infrastructure this year.</p>
        
        <p>The shift is clear: businesses are now measuring success based on engineering output and AI adoption rather than headcount. It's not about having more people anymore - it's about having the right capabilities.</p>
        
        <p>TCS has been particularly honest about this, stating that their layoffs stem from "skills misalignment" - especially at mid and senior levels where current skills don't match today's technology demands. It's a brutal but honest assessment of where the industry stands.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What You Can Actually Do About It</h2>
        <div class="action-list">
            <h3>Practical Steps Forward</h3>
            <div class="action-item"><strong>Focus on AI-adjacent fields:</strong> Cybersecurity, DevOps, embedded systems, and prompt engineering are growing despite automation. These areas still need human expertise and creativity.</div>
            
            <div class="action-item"><strong>Don't wait to be pushed:</strong> The writing is on the wall. Start upskilling now, explore freelance work, and build diverse professional skills. Waiting for your company to train you might be too late.</div>
            
            <div class="action-item"><strong>Shift your value proposition:</strong> Move beyond just "being present" to delivering measurable impact. Build a portfolio that shows real AI contributions, not just process involvement.</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What's Getting Automated by 2030</h2>
        <p>Let's be realistic about what's coming. Front-end development, UI/UX design templates, basic content writing, data entry, and testing support are already being handled more efficiently by AI. Large Language Models are getting scary good at generating design structures and even writing code.</p>
        
        <p>Administrative support, transcription, customer service, and junior analyst roles are being absorbed by AI-powered assistants faster than most people realize.</p>
        
        <p>But there's hope in complexity. Back-end development, especially system architecture, database optimization, and API integrations, remains challenging for AI. Strategic roles in cybersecurity, DevOps, and quantum computing still need human problem-solving and creativity - areas where AI still struggles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="perspective">
            <h2>My Take on All This</h2>
            <p>What used to work in enterprise IT - hiring large teams for visibility, process-heavy delivery models, and paper-based milestones - simply doesn't cut it anymore. Clients and employers now expect practical innovation and AI fluency, not bureaucratic checkboxes.</p>
            
            <p>The firing patterns we're seeing aren't really about underperformance. They're about long-term dormancy. Employees in passive or support-heavy roles who haven't evolved into engineering or AI-integrated functions are being let go. In 2025, the measurement is hands-on technical output, not how long you've been around.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="bottom-line">
            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>To not just survive but actually thrive in this AI-driven era, organizations must prioritize innovation over headcount, and individuals need to evolve from passive contributors to visible, high-impact performers.</p>
            <p><strong>Value now lies in real impact, not just showing up.</strong></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What Do You Think?</h2>
        <p>I've written this based on what I'm observing across major tech firms - not generated by AI, but from real industry patterns. The question I keep asking myself is: How are we collectively evolving our work cultures to match today's reality?</p>
        
        <p>Are we preparing for the future, or are we still operating like it's 2019? I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you're adapting to these changes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Feel free to share your ideas - I'm happy to discuss any thoughts you have on this topic. And if you're looking to break into the AI field, I'd be glad to help guide you in the right direction.</strong></p>
